### 2.3.1 Absorption

Montelukast is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist. For oral administration the following parameters play a role with regard to the absorption kinetics of a compound, which can be estimated with PBPK: solubility, lipophilicity and intestinal permeability. Montelukast is a strongly lipophilic drug. The final lipophilicity was estimated to be lower than the reported values, as with lipophilicity values above 3-4 log units the drug already reached maximal permeability levels.

### 2.3.2 Distribution

It has been determined that the protein binding of montelukast to plasma proteins exceeds 99% ([FDA drug label](#5-References)).  The fraction unbound (fu) of vancomycin is built-in as 0.0018 as also reported by Marzolini et al. ([Marzolini 2017](#5-References)).

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built-in in PK-Sim, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation method by Rodgers and Rowland, and PK-Sim standard cell permeability calculation method. Specific organ permeability normalized to surface area was automatically calculated by PK-Sim.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Montelukast is mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 (72%) ([Marzolini 2017](#5-References)).  The final montelukast model applies metabolism by CYP2C8, and minor involved enzymes CYP3A4/5 (16%) CYP2C9 (12%) and glomerular filtration ([Marzolini 2017, Filppula 2011, Zhou 2017](#5-References)) and adequately described the pharmacokinetics of montelukast in adults.
