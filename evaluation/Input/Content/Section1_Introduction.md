The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a physiology-based  pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model for montelukast in adults.

Montelukast is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptor 1, used in the maintenance treatment of asthma. Montelukast is mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 (72%) ([Marzolini 2017](#5-References)).  Montelukast is a strongly lipophilic drug. The final lipophilicity was estimated to be lower than the reported values, as with lipophilicity values above 3-4 log units the drug already reached maximal permeability levels. The final montelukast model applies metabolism by CYP2C8, and minor involved enzymes CYP3A4/5 (16% ) CYP2C9 (12%) and glomerular filtration ([Marzolini 2017, Filppula 2011, Zhou 2017](#5-References)) and adequately described the pharmacokinetics of montelukast in adults.

The montelukast model is a whole-body PBPK model, allowing for dynamic translation between individuals. The montelukast report demonstrates the level of confidence in the montelukast PBPK model build with the OSP suite with regard to reliable predictions of montelukast pharmacokinetics (PK) in adults during model-informed drug development.
