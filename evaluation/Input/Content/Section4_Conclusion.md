The final montelukast PBPK model applies elimination mainly by CYP2C8 and adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of montelukast in adults receiving intravenous and oral SD and MD of montelukast ranging from 2-10mg, for different types of tablet formulations. 

This model could be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions (DDI), and translation to special populations such as pediatrics with regard to CYP2C8 based elimination.
